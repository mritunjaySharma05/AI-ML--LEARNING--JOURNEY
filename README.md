# My AI/ML Learning Journey

Hi! I'm **Mritunjay Sharma**, a BCA student from Himachal Pradesh, starting my journey to become an AI/ML engineer.  
This repository is where I’m documenting my learning, day-by-day, as I explore AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and real-world projects.

I'm following a structured 3–4 month roadmap to become job-ready, dedicating 2–3 hours daily to learning and building.

## How to Use This Repo

If you're also starting out in AI/ML, you can follow along with my notes and build your own journey.  
Each log contains key concepts, reflections, and learning outcomes.

Let’s learn, build, and grow together!
