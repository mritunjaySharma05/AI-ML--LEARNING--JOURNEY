# My AI/ML Learning Journey

Hi! I'm **Mritunjay Sharma**, a BCA student from Himachal Pradesh, starting my journey to become an AI/ML engineer.  
This repository is where I’m documenting my learning, day-by-day, as I explore AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and real-world projects.

I'm following a structured 3–4 month roadmap to become job-ready, dedicating 2–3 hours daily to learning and building.

## Python Libraries I’m Learning

I’m learning and using important Python libraries that are essential for AI/ML:

- [**NumPy**](pyhton_libraries/numpycomplete.ipynb) – For numerical operations and matrix manipulation *(notebook coming soon)*  
- [**Pandas**](#) – For data handling, cleaning, and analysis *(notebook coming soon)*
- [**Matplotlib / Seaborn**](#) – For data visualization *(coming soon)*  
- [**Scikit-learn**](#) – For ML algorithms *(upcoming)*

## Projects

Coming soon! As I complete concepts, I’ll start building mini-projects like:
- Global Hapiness Report Analysis(Data Analysis project) 
- Linear Regression from Scratch
- Spam Mail Dectector 
- Titanic Survival Prediction
- Image Classifier using CNN
- Movie Recommendation System
- And more...

## How to Use This Repo

If you're also starting out in AI/ML, you can follow along with my notes and build your own journey.  
Each log contains key concepts, reflections, and learning outcomes.

Let’s learn, build, and grow together!
