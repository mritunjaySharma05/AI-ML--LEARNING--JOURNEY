## What I Learned Today

Today I explored Python fundamentals that are essential for AI and machine learning:

- **Variables**: To store values like strings and numbers.
- **Strings**: Text data and basic string operations.
- **Lists**: Ordered collections to hold multiple values.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for structured data.
- **Loops**: Using `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions.
- **Functions**: Defining reusable blocks of code to organize logic.
