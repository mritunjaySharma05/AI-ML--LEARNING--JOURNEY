## What I Learned Today

### 1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- AI is the field of creating machines or software that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.
- Examples: speech recognition, image recognition, decision-making, translation.

### 2. What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- ML is a subset of AI.
- It's about feeding data to algorithms that learn patterns and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.
- Example: predicting house prices based on past data.

### 3. What is Deep Learning?
- Deep Learning is a subset of ML.
- It uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep").
- It excels in tasks like image recognition, NLP, and voice synthesis.

### 4. Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data (e.g., spam or not spam).
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering customers).
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The model learns by trial and error, using feedback (reward/punishment).

## Reflection
Today was about setting the foundation. I now understand the relationship between AI, ML, and Deep Learning, and the major types of ML. Excited to dive deeper into each of these in the coming days!
