# Day 10 – Decision Trees: Visualizing ML Logic

**Date:** May 25, 2025

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

I implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier** — a powerful and interpretable model in Machine Learning.  
This model helps us **understand decisions visually** through a tree-like structure.

## ML Pipeline

| Step            | Description                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Model Used**   | `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn.tree` |
| **Input Features** | Age, Marks                                  |
| **Output Label** | Passed (Yes/No)                              |
| **Visualization** | Visualized how the model makes decisions    |

## Why Decision Trees?

- Simple yet powerful  
- Can handle both **classification** and **regression**  
- Easy to **visualize and explain**  
- Helps in **feature importance** analysis

---

## Tools Used

- `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`  
- `sklearn.tree.plot_tree`  
- `matplotlib.pyplot`

---

## Skills Gained

- Built a decision tree classifier  
- Learned how tree-based models split data  
- Visualized decision-making paths  
- Understood model interpretability
