## 🧠 Key Concepts Recap

| Concept                    | Explanation                |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Decision Tree              | Splits data based on rules |
| `DecisionTreeClassifier()` | Model from sklearn         |
| `tree.plot_tree()`         | Draws a visual tree        |
| Pros                       | Easy to interpret          |
| Cons                       | Can overfit easily         |

## 🔍 What You Practiced

- Used `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn.tree`
- Visualized the tree using `plot_tree()`
- Observed how simple IF-ELSE rules predict outcomes
- Compared how tree depth impacts accuracy

---

## 📈 Takeaways

- **Great for understanding data** visually.
- **But** without pruning, can **overfit** on small datasets.
- Tree visualization helps explain decisions to non-tech folks.
