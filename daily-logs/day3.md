# Day 3 – Python Recap + NumPy Basics

**Date:** May 18, 2025

## What I Learned Today

Today I revised some core Python concepts and started learning **NumPy**, one of the most important libraries for AI/ML.

### Python Recap
- Reviewed variables, functions, loops, and lists.
- Practiced how to define and call functions efficiently.

### NumPy Basics
- Learned what NumPy is: a powerful library for numerical computations.
- Explored the `numpy` array and how it is more efficient than a Python list.

## Key NumPy Concepts I Covered

- **Creating Arrays**: Using `np.array()` to create arrays from lists.
- **Array of Zeros**: `np.zeros()` creates an array filled with 0s.
- **Array of Ones**: `np.ones()` creates an array filled with 1s.
- **Reshape**: Changes the shape of an array without changing its data.
- **Random Values**: `np.random.rand()` generates random numbers.
- **Array Indexing**: Accessing elements, slices, and modifying data.

## Reflection

NumPy is super useful and very fast for mathematical operations. I’m beginning to understand how important it is for data manipulation in ML. Tomorrow, I’ll explore more array operations and start learning about Pandas.
