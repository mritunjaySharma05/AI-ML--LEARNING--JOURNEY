# Day 4 – NumPy Indexing, Slicing & Operations

**Date:** May 19, 2025

## What I Learned Today

Today I continued learning **NumPy**, focusing on how to access and manipulate data inside arrays efficiently.

### Topics Covered:

- **Indexing**: Accessing specific elements in 1D, 2D arrays
- **Slicing**: Extracting portions of arrays using slicing syntax
- **Boolean Indexing**: Filtering arrays based on conditions
- **Basic Operations**: Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Aggregate Functions**: `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.min()`, `np.max()`, etc.

## Reflection

These operations are powerful and fast — they help prepare and manipulate data easily, which is essential in ML workflows. NumPy feels more intuitive now, and I'm excited to try combining it with real datasets soon.
