# Day 5 – Pandas: Data Handling for Machine Learning

**Date:** May 20, 2025

## What I Learned Today

Today, I started learning **Pandas**, one of the most powerful Python libraries for handling and analyzing tabular data. It's especially useful when working with datasets in CSV, Excel, or SQL formats — which is essential for ML and data science workflows.

---

## Key Topics Covered

- Introduction to Pandas and its role in data handling
- Series and DataFrames: understanding 1D and 2D data structures
- Creating Series and DataFrames from lists and dictionaries
- Loading data from a CSV file using `read_csv()`
- Viewing and understanding data with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
- Filtering data using conditions (e.g., `df[df["Marks"] > 70]`)

## Practice Activity

I used a small `students.csv` file to try out basic Pandas operations. It included sample data like names, ages, marks, and pass/fail status. I applied various filtering and display methods to get comfortable with the syntax and behavior.

## Reflection

Pandas makes data handling intuitive and efficient. Understanding how to manipulate rows and columns, load files, and extract meaningful insights from raw data is a big step forward. Looking forward to combining this with NumPy and visualization tools soon!
