# Day 8 – My First Machine Learning Model

**Date:** May 23, 2025

## What I Did Today

Today, I built my **first ML model** — from raw data to predictions — following a step-by-step process.

---

## The 8 Core Steps I Followed

1. **Cleaned the Data**  
   Used Pandas to remove missing values, handle duplicates, and prepare clean input.

2. **Explored and Visualized**  
   Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand data patterns and feature distributions.

3. **Defined Features and Target**  
   Selected input features (`X`) and output label (`y`) for the model.

4. **Split the Dataset**  
   Divided data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

5. **Chose a Model**  
   Used `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn` for classification.

6. **Trained the Model**  
   Fit the model on training data using `.fit()`.

7. **Made Predictions**  
   Used `.predict()` on the test data to get predicted outputs.

8. **Evaluated Performance**  
   Measured accuracy and classification report using `accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix`, etc.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib.pyplot`  
- `seaborn`  
- `sklearn.model_selection`  
- `sklearn.linear_model`  
- `sklearn.metrics`

---

## Skills Gained

- Understood the complete ML pipeline  
- Built and evaluated a logistic regression model  
- Gained confidence in writing real ML code

## Notebook

My first ML implementation is saved in [`day8.ipynb`](day8.ipynb).
